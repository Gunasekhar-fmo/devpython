# Preface 

### What does devops mean : 
1. Reducing the sdlc life cycle time . 
2. Two-way collaboration between development and operation teams 
3. Two-way collaboration between Development and Operation teams.
4. Turnaround of Ops tasks in minutes to hours, not days to weeks.
5. Strong involvement from developers; otherwise, it’s back to Devs versus Ops.
6. Operations people need development skills—at least Bash and Python.
7. Developer people need operational skills—their responsibilities don’t end with writing the code, but with deploying the system to production and monitoring alerts.
8. Automation, automation, automation: you can’t accurately automate without Dev skills, and you can’t correctly automate without Ops skills
9. Ideally: self-service for developers, at least in terms of deploying code.
Can be achieved via CI/CD pipelines.
10. GitOps.
11. Bidirectional everything between Development and Operations (tooling, knowl‐ edge, etc.).
12. Constant collaboration in design, implementation, deployment—and yes, auto‐ mation—can’t be successful without cooperation.
13. if it isn’t automated, it’s broken.
14. Cultural: Hierarchy < Process.
15. Microservices > Monolithic.
16. The continuous deployment system is the heart and soul of the software team.
17. There are no superheroes.
18. Continuous delivery isn’t an option; it is a mandate.
